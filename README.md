## TL;DR

This license grants anyone the freedom to use, modify, and distribute your code - **except** for specific entities [listed below](#ban-list-the-entity). The ban is **contagious**: every derivative work must also exclude those entities, forever.

## Ban List (the Entity)

- [*Tencent Holdings Ltd.*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tencent)
- [*Baidu, Inc.*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baidu)
- [*Sina Corporation*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sina_Corporation)

...including their subsidiaries, affiliates, contractors, or any entity owned or majority-controlled by them.

## Q&A

- **Q: Is this license legally enforceable?**
- A: Probably not. But neither is the Entity' dignity.
- **Q: What if the Entity tries to open an issue or contribute a PR?**
- A: Close it with `Resolved: lol no`.
- **Q: Why?**
- A: Because I want to.

**Disclaimer**: This license is satirical and not intended to be legally binding. The Entity are likely not legally bound by this, but we both know they deserve it. For serious legal needs, consult a lawyer (or a therapist).
